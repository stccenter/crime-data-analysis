# Black Lives Matter Protest Events:

### Data Collected: 456 protests from 29 counties

---

#### Data Summary:
This is an open-source database of Black Lives Matter protests from 31 counties across the United States. The database contains protest date, protest location, number of attendees, source, notable attendees, number of injuries/deaths, and additional info. It can be used by scientists to study the spatiotemporal impact of Black Lives Matter protests or be used by historians to visualize the scope/impact of the BLM movement.

#### Notable Results:
Overall, there has been very little/no impact of Black Lives Matter protests on the spread of Covid-19. However, there has been a large cultural impact surrounding the protests. Social media/News data indicates that protests have caused a cultural shift in mindset and brought more attention to the movement. Data will be used by the CVT - Harvard CGA in the creation of data visualizations.

#### Team:
